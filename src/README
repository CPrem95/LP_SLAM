# ROS2 Workspace for UWB Radar SLAM

This is the ROS2 workspace of the proposed UWB Radar SLAM.

## Instructions

1. Clone the files and build it.

2. Go to DOI Link: [https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/shx8-gw47](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/shx8-gw47) and find the datasets (there are 4 datasets from the experiments mentioned in the paper).

3. Select the required dataset (e.g. `experiment_1_data`) and find the `dataset_mph6_mpp5.mat` file.

4. Copy the `dataset_mph6_mpp5.mat` to the `dataset` directory in the ROS2 workspace.
